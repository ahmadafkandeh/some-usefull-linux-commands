1 - attach usb to serial device to computer
2 - find the usbname with this command:
		dmesg | grep tty #mine was ttyUSB0
3 - Then try to run minicom with "sudo minicom -s", go to "Serial port setup" and change the first line to /dev/ttyUSB0.
4 - give permissions to usb to serial device:
        sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

Now every thing is fine.
